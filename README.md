# Sports-Analytics
For traning the YOLO detection model, I used a version of soccernet that was used by: https://github.com/Mostafa-Nafie/Football-Object-Detection but also had my own aleterations and curations to the dataset.
The line segmentation mode was  trained on soccernet calibration dtaset: https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-calibration and the original dataset had 26 classes which were curated to 5 classes.
